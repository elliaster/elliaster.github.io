			On November 13, 2017 a college fair was held here at Information Technology High School. During this event we were required to dress in atleast business casual. The event was held in the gym. We would be introduced to several different colleges that we
			might be interested in. We would go around the gym and talk to representatives from these colleges that we might be interested in. We asked for information such as the minimum requirements to get into that college, what majors did they have, what school
			life for the students were like, and what the graduation rate was in the school. Things like that, that we need to know before going to a college. During this event I was able to get some information from several schools that I was interested in.
