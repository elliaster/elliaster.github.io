                    This final project was done in Spring Semester, May 2020. This final project was to create a 30-second animation. We were to do this from scratch within the span of around 2 weeks. I created all the assets myself. For this animation, I used Adobe Animate CC 2019 as well as Illustrator CC 2019. Animate was used for keyframing and compiling all the assets together for the final product. Illustrator was used in order to create the character designs and for all the other assets such as the mountains and the other backdrops used in the animation. All the assets were created with the pen tool and gradient tool.
