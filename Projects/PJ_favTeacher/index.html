		<p id="impactSectionParagraph">
			&emsp;Jorge Luis Cordero, known to me as Mr. Cordero, has made a big impact on me as I am very interested in art, and up until high school I didn't have an art class that interested me, where as Mr. Cordero had. He helped me get back into drawing and let me realize how much fun art is. His class is one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever had the pleasure of taking. I appreciate what he has done for me. If not for him I would not be actively trying to better myself at art.
