                    <span class="indent">This project entailed the restoration of the above-shown picture. I had to use Adobe Photoshop to
                    recreate an undamaged version using the spot healing brush, healing brush, paintbrush, and other
                    tools provided by Adobe Photoshop. The project was a challenge at the time since I had only done
                    small retouches to photos up to that point. However, it was a great learning experience as it gave
                    me a greater understanding of how to fix/retouch old photos or other images that I may need in the
                    future.</span>

                    <span class="indent">This is an illustration made for my Visual Design class. The theme of the project was Identity. So I
                    chose to draw a faceless human walking in an endless void of white and black. The person is
                    wondering who he is. I feel like it makes sense for the theme of identity since, when not knowing
                    who you are as a person does feel isolating from the others around you. In this project I used Adobe
                    Photoshop for everything from making the human to the sign and backdrop, using basic brushes and
                    gradients.</span>

                    <span class="indent">This project had my class go into groups of 4 and create a yearbook that had all the members of the
                    class in it. We had to create the assets ourselves. In this project, I was the lead designer as well
                    as the director. It was my job to create the backgrounds and other assets for the book. The theme we
                    chose was space so to match with that theme I painted all the students over to have a NASA-like
                    uniform. I mainly spent my time in Adobe Photoshop making the planets, asteroids, and the space
                    shuttle keeping a consistent theme throughout the entire book. I did this using the lasso tool and
                    brush tool in Photoshop.</span>

                    <span class="indent">For this project, we were supposed to come up with an informational brochure. I decided to make a
                    brochure about education in the world. I had to research different conditions and other educational
                    institutions from other countries to understand the information and relay the information to the
                    reader. There are images of school children from other countries to help show the kinds of people
                    there are in the world and make it more relatable than just numbers.</span>

                    <span class="indent">This illustration was made as a submission to the Graphic Media Arts Competition in 2017. The
                    illustration was sketched on paper first and then completed on Adobe Illustrator. I heavily relied
                    on the pen tool for creating the lines and shapes seen in the illustration. There was use of
                    gradients for the moon as well. The stars were created by making a small circle into a symbol and
                    spraying the background with the Symbol Sprayer Tool. I was inspired by The Nightmare Before
                    Christmas movie by Tim Burton. I wanted to incorporate a very over accentuated feature within the
                    illustration so I went with a mountain that curves inward at the peak.</span>
